## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Conventional Commits have a really neat, simple, yet, well designed website, so I decided to make a clone of it to practice and improve my web development skills. Thank you to Conventional Commits for this design, I don't pretend on it, just making a clone with no harm intended.
